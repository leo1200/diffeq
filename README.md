# Numerical Approaches for Solving (Stiff) Differential Equations

This repository contains material accompanying the seminar talk by Daniel Richter and Leonard Storcks on "Classical Numerical Approaches for Solving (Stiff) Differential Equations" held in the Scientific Machine Learning Seminar by Dr. Tobias Buck from the AstroAI-Lab at Heidelberg University.

We hope, this repository can help everyone, keen on learning more on numerical solvers, stiff differential equations and programming and visualizing in Julia (although I have learned a bit of Julia only in the course of this project).

## Overview on the Material in the Repository
- Presentation slides: Numerical_Approaches_for_Solving_Differential_Equations.pdf
- Efficiently solving stiff differential equations at the hand of a simplified Brussletor problem: efficiently_solfving_stiff_differential_equations.ipynb / pdf
- Analysis of a simple linear stiff system: simple_stiff_example.py
- Phase space visualization for different integrators: stream_plots.py
- Example on the stability of the explicit Euler method: euler_live.ipynb
- Figures generated by the various scripts can be found in the figures folder
